1,What is a DDoS attack?,"A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is a cyber attack where multiple compromised systems, often infected with malware, are used to flood a target system or network with a large volume of traffic. This overwhelms the target, causing it to become slow or unavailable to legitimate users."
2,How can I secure my Wi-Fi network?,"To secure your Wi-Fi network, use strong passwords for both your Wi-Fi network and router, enable WPA2 or WPA3 encryption, change default SSID names, disable remote administration, and regularly update router firmware."
3,What is social engineering?,"Social engineering is a tactic used by attackers to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. It often involves psychological manipulation and deception, such as phishing emails, pretexting, or impersonation."
4,What is ransomware?,"Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim’s files or locks their system, demanding payment (usually in cryptocurrency) to restore access. It can spread through malicious email attachments, infected websites, or exploit kits."
5,How does two-factor authentication enhance security?,"Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two forms of authentication before accessing an account. This typically involves something the user knows (e.g., a password) and something they have (e.g., a code sent to their phone)."
6,What is a vulnerability assessment?,"A vulnerability assessment is a systematic review of security weaknesses in an organization’s IT infrastructure, applications, and processes. It identifies potential vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit and recommends measures to mitigate risks."
7,How does a VPN protect privacy online?,"A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts internet traffic between a user’s device and the VPN server, making it difficult for third parties to intercept or eavesdrop on communications. It also hides the user’s IP address, providing anonymity online."
8,What is a zero-day exploit?,"A zero-day exploit is a cyber attack that targets a previously unknown vulnerability in software or hardware. Since the vulnerability is not yet known to the vendor or public, there are no patches or fixes available, making it difficult to defend against."
9,What is data leakage prevention (DLP)?,"Data leakage prevention (DLP) is a set of technologies and policies designed to prevent sensitive data from being leaked, lost, or stolen. It includes monitoring and controlling data transfers, encryption, and user education."
10,How does a password manager improve security?,"A password manager securely stores and manages passwords for various online accounts, allowing users to generate complex, unique passwords for each account without having to remember them. This reduces the risk of password reuse and simplifies password management."
11,What are common signs of a phishing email?,"Common signs of a phishing email include spelling or grammar errors, urgent requests for personal information, generic greetings, suspicious links or attachments, and requests for financial transactions or sensitive data."
12,How does endpoint security protect against threats?,"Endpoint security solutions protect individual devices (endpoints) such as laptops, desktops, and mobile devices from security threats. They include antivirus software, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and device encryption."
13,What is a penetration test?,"A penetration test, also known as a pen test, is a simulated cyber attack on a computer system, network, or web application to identify security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by real attackers. It helps organizations assess their security posture and prioritize remediation efforts."
14,What is the principle of least privilege?,"The principle of least privilege is a security concept that restricts user access rights to the minimum permissions required to perform necessary tasks. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse of privileges."
15,What is an insider threat?,"An insider threat refers to security risks posed by individuals within an organization, such as employees, contractors, or partners, who misuse their access privileges to compromise security or cause harm. Insider threats can be intentional or unintentional."
16,How can I protect sensitive data in transit?,"To protect sensitive data in transit, use encryption protocols such as SSL/TLS when transmitting data over the internet, implement secure communication channels (e.g., VPNs), and avoid sending sensitive information via unsecured networks or protocols."
17,What is a security incident response plan?,"A security incident response plan is a documented set of procedures and protocols for responding to and mitigating security incidents such as data breaches, cyber attacks, or system compromises. It outlines roles, responsibilities, and actions to be taken during an incident."
18,How does encryption key management work?,"Encryption key management involves generating, storing, distributing, and rotating encryption keys used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data. It ensures that only authorized users can access encrypted data and helps protect against unauthorized access or data breaches."
19,What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?,"Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires users to provide two or more forms of authentication before accessing an account or system. This typically includes something the user knows, has, or is (e.g., password, token, biometric data)."
20,What is phishing?,"Phishing is a cyber attack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to trick individuals into providing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data."
21,How can I protect myself from malware?,"To protect yourself from malware, ensure your antivirus software is up-to-date, avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources, and regularly update your operating system and software."
22,What is a firewall?,A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks.
23,What is encryption?,"Encryption is the process of converting plaintext data into ciphertext to protect it from unauthorized access. It uses algorithms and keys to scramble the data, making it unreadable without the correct decryption key."
